1. What is TypeScript?
	By definition, “TypeScript is JavaScript for application-scale development.”
	TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
	TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C# or Java.
	The popular JavaScript framework Angular 2.0 is written in TypeScript.
	Mastering TypeScript can help programmers to write object-oriented programs and have them compiled to JavaScript, both on server side and client side.
	
	EXAMPLE:
	var message:string = "Hello World";	// var - keyword, message - variable name, string - data type, Hello World - value;
	console.log(message);
	On compiling, it will generate following JavaScript code.
	var message = "Hello World";
	console.log(message);
